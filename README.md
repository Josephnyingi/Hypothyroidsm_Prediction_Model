# Hypothyroidsm_Prediction_Model
This project aims to use healthcare data provided by Nairobi Hospital to a build a prediction model that determines whether or not a patient's symptoms indicate the existence of hypothyroid. The analysis compare the prediction models from DecisionTree Classifier and that of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to establish the best prediction model.
