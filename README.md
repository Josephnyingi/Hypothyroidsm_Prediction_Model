# Hypothyroidsm_Prediction_Model
This project aims to use healthcare data provided by Nairobi Hospital to a build a prediction model that determines whether or not a patient's symptoms indicate the existence of hypothyroid.The analysis compare the prediction models from DecisionTree Classifier and that of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to establish the best prediction model.
# Project description
Hypothyroidsm is a medical condition in which an individual's thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. This deficiency in thyroid hormone can disrupt crucial body functions such as body tempreture, heart rate and metabolism. Some of the general symptoms of hypothyroidsm include fatigue, muscle weakness, thinning hair, enlarged thyroid gland among others. The risks posed by a hypothyroid condition can be extreme when left untreated over a long period of time. Therefore, it is imperative that an accurate diagnosis is made as early as possible and treatment is administered appropriately.

This research aims to use robust machine learning algorithms to develop a prediction model that can identify whether or not a patient has a hypothyroid condition based on their symptoms. The model will be trained on thyroid patients' data that was collected by Nairobi Hospital.
# Technologies used
various python libraries
# Usage
This project demonstrates how DecisionTreeClassifiers and Support Vector Machine (SVM) can be applied on a prediction model of any similar use case.
